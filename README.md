## Features

- **Zero Code**: Hikko generates a website from a single config file, no need to write any code.
- **Components**: Hikko comes with a ~~wide range~~ of components to build your website.
- **Theming**: Hikko supports comprehensive theming to customize your website easily:
  <br>Each theme can include global CSS, component-specific CSS, and even an entirely new component structure.

## Usage

### Installation

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:devnyxie/hikko.git
```

#### Navitgate to the project directory

```bash
cd hikko
# or just open the project in your favorite code editor
```

### Write a config file

```yaml
# config.yaml
site_title: "My Site"
site_description: "This is my site"
theme: "example"
pages:
  - name: Home # Page name
    path: "" # Page path, "/"
    components:
      - componentName: blog # ./common/components/blog/Blog.tsx
        options: # Component related options
          title: "My Blog <3"
  - name: about
    path: about
    components:
      - componentName: profile
```

### Test your site (optional)

```bash
`npm install` or `yarn`
# This command will install all the dependencies required by the configurator and the website.
```

```bash
`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
# This command will:
# 1. Run the configurator to generate the website
# 2. Start a development server
# 3. Start a watcher to regenerate the website on any Hikko related file change.
```

> [!WARNING]
> It's important to try to build your website before deploying it to ensure that everything is working as expected. It's easy to pass wrong props to components, and since we are using TypeScript, website will simply not build if there are any errors.

```bash
npm run build
# This command will:
# 1. Run the configurator to generate the website
# 2. Build the website
```

```bash
npm run start
# This command will:
# Start the built website
```

## to-do

- [ ] Build an actual wide range of components
