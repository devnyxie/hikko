# we have followed the OLD tutorial.
# new one: https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog
# notes:
# [slug] and page.tsx can be in the same folder. I think the configurator may re-write the folder, so let's make sure we can have separate blog component + page.


# !!!

pages: # List of pages to be added in the app
  - src: "./page" # Directory/File where certain page is located. 
                  # If dir, all TSX files will be checked for mentioned imports and copied to the app.
    dest: "./post/[slug]" # Destination in the app.
